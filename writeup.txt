\f0\fs24 \cf0 AXI-Stream protocol is used for applications that focus mainly on a data-centric and data-flow paradigm.  The concept of an address is not present and is not required.  Furthermore, AXI-Stream acts as a single unidirectional channel for a handshake data flow.  AXI-Stream is better optimized for performance in data flow applications and is specialized around a given application space.  Therefore, AXI-Stream is best suitable to create a convolution unit that is able to compute the convolutions that exist inside the first layer of AlexNet.  The other alternatives included AXI-Lite and AXI; however, these were not as suitable.  AXI-Lite has traditional memory mapped address/data interface and has single data cycle only.  AXI only has traditional memory mapped address/data interface.\
